# Image Grid

This is a solution of the [Basic Dockerfile](https://roadmap.sh/projects/basic-dockerfile).When this Docker image is run, it should print “Hello, Captain!” to the console before exiting.

You have the ability to pass your name to the Docker image as an argument, and have the Docker image print “Hello, [your name]!” instead of “Hello, Captain!”.
